- Cells: Grizzly will include a preview (experimental) release of cells functionality. Cells provides a new way to scale nova deployments, including the ability to have compute clusters (cells) in different geographic locations all under the same nova API. See Cells docs for more details.
- Availability Zones: Availability Zone support has been enhanced. Previously, the only way to set the availability zone for a given compute node was via its configuration file. You can now set a node's availability zone via the API.
- Admin APIs: There have been multiple additions to the API for administrative actions. This has been done to continue to move away from needing the nova-manage utility for most administrative tasks.
- API support for instance passwords: This enhancement to nova improves support for instances that require passwords to work, such as those running Windows. Instances can now generate and post an encrypted password to the metadata API (write once). This password can be retrieved via the public nova API. This functionality can be integrated with a guest initialization tool such as cloud-init.
- Improved MySQL connector performance: Some enhancements have been made to allow better interaction with MySQL and the threading model used by nova (eventlet).
- Database archiving: Support for pruning deleted items and placing them in separate tables to keep the most frequently written tables from growing without bounds.
- Instance Action Tracking: Nova has been updated to keep track of all actions performed on an instance. There is an API extension for accessing this information. Viewing the list of instance actions provides deeper insight into the history of an instance. It also provides much better error reporting for users and administrators.
- Quantum Security Groups Proxy: When managing security groups through Nova's API, all actions will be proxied to Quantum when Quantum is the network provider.
- File injection without mounting guest filesystem: Nova has the ability to use libguestfs to support file injection into a guest filesystem. Previously this was done by mounting the guest filesystem on the host. This has been refactored to use libguestfs APIs that do not require mounting the guest filesystem, which is much more secure.
- Default Security Group Rules: Nova can now be made to add rules to the default security group when it is created for a tenant.
- libvirt Custom Hardware: The libvirt driver in Nova will now check for properties on an image that specify specific hardware types that should be used. An example of when this is useful is for an image that does not support virtio, and should use a fully virtualized hardware type instead.
- libvirt Spice Console: The libvirt driver in Nova now supports Spice virtual consoles.
- Unique Instance Naming: When issuing an API command to create multiple servers, Nova will now give each instance a unique name based on a configured template. Previously all instances would have the same name.
- Availability Zones in OpenStack API: Support for availability zones has been enhanced in the OpenStack API. You can now list availability zones through the API. The availability zone for an instance is also included in instance details.
- Glance Direct Image File Copy: If Glance provides Nova a URL to the image location on a shared filesystem, Nova will now get the image content from there instead of through the Glance API. This will result in faster instance boot times under some circumstances.
- Network adapter hot-plug: It is now possible to hot-plug a pre created port to a running instance.
